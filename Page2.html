        <h3>Write Up</h3>
        <p>For this assignment I chose these colors one being that I am a fan of the Warriors and they are in the playoffs right now and two being I really liked these specific shades of blue I usecd for the homework. The two images I used are two of my favorite players in basketball right now with Stephen Curry and Jordan Poole. Steph is honestly my favorite player to ever play the game of basketball.</p>

      <h3>The Aside Section</h3>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#">NAV #1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">NAV #2</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">NAV #3</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
      <p>The aside can represent secondary content outside of an article, that is considered secondary to the main content in the article. The aside can be cool typography designs, quotes, advertising, etc... The aside can also be utlized within an article, although in this instance there should be some parallel to the content of the article.</p>
      <p>Although it may look like a sidbar in the sense of a navigational widget, it is always wise to use the nav element instead of an aside when you would like to place additional navigational elements.</p>
