      <h2>2022 Playoff Run</h2>
      <p>The Golden States Warriors finished the season as the 3rd best team in the Western Conference with a record of 53-29. As the 3rd seed of the Western Conference they will play the 6th seed, the Denver Nuggets, and potentially the 2nd seed, Memphis Grizzilies, or 7th seed, Minnesota Timberwolves, in the second round.  </p>

      <p>The aside can represent secondary content outside of an article, that is considered secondary to the main content in the article. The aside can be cool typography designs, quotes, advertising, etc... The aside can also be utlized within an article, although in this instance there should be some parallel to the content of the article.</p>
      <p>Although it may look like a sidbar in the sense of a navigational widget, it is always wise to use the nav element instead of an aside when you would like to place additional navigational elements.</p>
